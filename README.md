# Freelancing-website

We are proposing in building a web base system that makes freelancing easy and less time consuming. The system will help user to create their own project that they can post so as other users can apply and work on it to get paid for their role. A user can post or apply for a project as long as he/she has an account on this platform. The main aim of this system is to make the job searching process less tiresome and providing the best candidate for given project.

As we go in detail about this system, ever user will have a board which he/she can view an available project that is open for applicant. The user can apply for the given project by uploading the needed requirements and wait for the project creator response. If the project creator is satisfied by the applicant resume the project creator can hire the applicant and the applicant may accept or decline the creatorâ€™s offering. Also, user can create a project for hiring by providing information about the project, then view all the applicants for the project and hire the best applicant.
